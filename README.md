# About
This is a simple program written in python that allows you to download mars rover images via the NASA API. To use the program, you need an API key, I will not provide my own key, however, I will tell you how to get one.

## How do I get an API key?

1. Go to [the NASA API website](api.nasa.gov)
2. Scroll down to the sign up page and put your info in there.
3. After that, you will receive an API key in your inbox within a few minutes.
